Imagine you have a Sale Database consists of two tables:

 Goods table
>  goods(
>    id int,
>    name text
>  );
 Sales Table
>  sales(
>    id int,
>    good_id int references goods(id),
>    price double precision,
>    sale_date date
>  );

First Task

 Required to create sales statistics for each good.
 This query must have following columns:
 - good title
 - minimum of saled goods
 - minimum good price
 - maximum good price


This statistics should be collected for particular interval, orded by amount of saled goods.
This statistics must have the full list of goods even if there are no sales of particular good in the interval.

Second Task

After some time understood that only one unique good ca be saled in one day.
Thats why required to remove all unnecessary entries (if there are more than one sales in one day - remove everything except an entry with maximum ID).
Make changes in Sales Table to prevent from the appearance of duplicate records.
